## Git Workflow

- Always create a feature branch based on a GitHub issue before making changes. Use a naming convention like `<type>/<short-description>` (e.g., `feat/add-collector`, `fix/parse-error`).
- Never commit directly to `main`.
- Always create a pull request for merging changes back into `main`.
